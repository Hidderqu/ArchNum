*ISS* How-To (15/03/2018)
---
This Instruction Set Simulator is ready to launch, out of the box.

- Write a piece of assembler code or choose one from the ASM_Programs folder
- Run launch.py with Python 3
- Make sure to run the 'install' command on the first run
- :)

*Debugging*
---
The most common issue is the ISS not being able to find your python path.
For this, open the Makefile and change 'python3' to your own Python3 path.
